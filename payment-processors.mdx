<Tip>
Feel free to skip ahead to: [API Integration](/voice-api-integration). We've already added a default account called `example-co` to your account when in test mode.

## Connecting your payment processors

On protegee, you can connect as many payment providers as you like. The way they are distinguished is by specifying the `vendor` field in any requests to Protegee. To get you started, we added a test one called `example-co` that you can start using immediately.

### Setup

Go to [Vendors](https://protegee.ai/vendors). This is where you'll be able to see all your available vendors as well as add new ones.

### For Stripe

Connecting your vendor is as easy as sharing an onboarding link with your customers:
<img

  src="/images/vendors-stripe.png"
  alt="adding a stripe vendor"
/>

Just enter a name you'd like to use to refer to your customer. For example, if the company was called `Example Co`, name it `example-co`. If it was `Shake Shack`, name it `shake-shack`.

### For Authorize.net

Same idea here. Obtain the `Login ID` and the `Transaction Key` from your customer, enter it here, and give it an appropriate vendor name. For example, if the company was called `Example Co`, name it `example-co`. If it was `Shake Shack`, name it `shake-shack`.
