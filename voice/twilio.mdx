## Integration

### Step 1 - Set Context

Make a webhook to the [Set Context](/api-reference/endpoint/set-context_twilio) endpoint.

For example:
```python agent.py
import requests

url = "https://protegee.ai/voice/api/v1/twilio/set-context"

querystring = {"api_token":"test_TASDYICNPFGSDRDRLGOILWWV"}

payload = {
    "caller": "+16151231234",
    "description": "Reservation for two at The Gourmet Bistro, 7:30 PM on December 30th, 2024, Table 12, Indoor seating, Special request: Window view, Confirmation number: 12345",
    "price": "10.00",
    "vendor": "example-co",
    "customer_id": "",
    "persona": "english-jessica",
    "callback": "+14155552671",
    "email": "my_customer@company.com",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "transaction_type": "once",
    "memory": "John Doe has called in order to make a reservation at Gourmet Bistro. He is celebrating a friends birthday."
}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers, params=querystring)

print(response.text)
```

### Step 2 - Transfer call:

Just like it sounds - this is just a simple transfer. If you were using python, this would look like:

```python
voice_response.dial(number="<insert protegee's transfer number here>")
```

### Step 3 - Receive Callback (optional):

If you specified a number in the `callback` field, the caller will be transfered back to this number. There is nothing you need to do for this step.

### Step 4 - Get Context (optional):

After the payment portion is complete, [Protegee](https://protegee.ai/) will transfer the call back to whatever number is specified in the `callback` field.
In that agent, you'll want to make a webhook to the [Get Context](/api-reference/endpoint/get-context_twilio) endpoint.

This will give you all the context you need to continue the call.

For example:
```python agent.py
import requests

url = "https://good-quagga-largely.ngrok-free.app/voice/api/v1/twilio/get-context"

querystring = {"api_token":"test_TASDYICNPFGSDRDRLGOILWWV"}

payload = {"caller": "+16151231234"}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers, params=querystring)

print(response.text)
```

<Info>
  **Hint**: You can use the `memory` field in [Set Context](/api-reference/endpoint/set-context_twilio) in order to share information between your agents! For example, you can pass a summary of the call.
